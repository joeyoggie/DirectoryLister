This is a small add-on for Windows Explorer. It adds a new context menu option in the right-click context menu that allows you to see
the size of each subfolder inside the clicked folder.

# Instructions
1- Download the attached installer zip file.  
2- Extract it to your desktop (or any other folder, but make sure DirectoryListerInstaller.exe and DirectoryLister.exe are in the
same folder)  
3- Open DirectoryListerInstaller.exe (and allow the UAC prompt, which is needed to edit the registry to add the new context menu option)  
4- Click on Install, and hopeully it should tell you that it succeeded.  
5- Right click on any folder and you'll see the new option "Show subfolders info"  

To uninstall it, just open DirectoryListerInstaller and click on Uninstall.
